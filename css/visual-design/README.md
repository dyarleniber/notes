## Visual Design

Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges

Visual Design in web development is a broad topic. It combines typography, color theory, graphics, animation, and page layout to help deliver a site's message. The definition of good design is a well-discussed subject, with many books on the theme.

At a basic level, most web content provides a user with information. The visual design of the page can influence its presentation and a user's experience. In web development, HTML gives structure and semantics to a page's content, and CSS controls the layout and appearance of it.

This section covers some of the basic tools developers use to create their own visual designs.



Applied Visual Design: Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property

This section of the curriculum focuses on Applied Visual Design. The first group of challenges build on the given card layout to show a number of core principles.

Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the text-align property.

text-align: justify; causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.

text-align: center; centers the text

text-align: right; right-aligns the text

And text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.



Applied Visual Design: Use the strong Tag to Make Text Bold

To make text bold, you can use the strong tag. This is often used to draw attention to text and symbolize that it is important. With the strong tag, the browser applies the CSS of font-weight: bold; to the element.


Applied Visual Design: Use the u Tag to Underline Text

To underline text, you can use the u tag. This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, or something to remember. With the u tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: underline; to the element.

Note: Try to avoid using the u tag when it could be confused for a link. Anchor tags also have a default underlined formatting.


Applied Visual Design: Use the em Tag to Italicize Text

To emphasize text, you can use the em tag. This displays text as italicized, as the browser applies the CSS of font-style: italic; to the element.


Applied Visual Design: Use the s Tag to Strikethrough Text

To strikethrough text, which is when a horizontal line cuts across the characters, you can use the s tag. It shows that a section of text is no longer valid. With the s tag, the browser applies the CSS of text-decoration: line-through; to the element.


Applied Visual Design: Create a Horizontal Line Using the hr Element

You can use the hr tag to add a horizontal line across the width of its containing element. This can be used to define a change in topic or to visually separate groups of content.


Applied Visual Design: Adjust the background-color Property of Text

Instead of adjusting your overall background or the color of the text to make the foreground easily readable, you can add a background-color to the element holding the text you want to emphasize. This challenge uses rgba() instead of hex codes or normal rgb().

rgba stands for:
  r = red
  g = green
  b = blue
  a = alpha/level of opacity

The RGB values can range from 0 to 255. The alpha value can range from 1, which is fully opaque or a solid color, to 0, which is fully transparent or clear. rgba() is great to use in this case, as it allows you to adjust the opacity. This means you don't have to completely block out the background.

You'll use background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1) for this challenge. It produces a dark gray color that is nearly transparent given the low opacity value of 0.1.


Applied Visual Design: Adjust the Size of a Header Versus a Paragraph Tag

The font size of header tags (h1 through h6) should generally be larger than the font size of paragraph tags. This makes it easier for the user to visually understand the layout and level of importance of everything on the page. You use the font-size property to adjust the size of the text in an element.


Applied Visual Design: Add a box-shadow to a Card-like ElementPassed

The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element.

The box-shadow property takes values for

offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),

offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),

blur-radius,

spread-radius and

color, in that order.

The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each box-shadow element.

Here's an example of the CSS to create multiple shadows with some blur, at mostly-transparent black colors:

box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 



Applied Visual Design: Decrease the Opacity of an Element

The opacity property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely, the transparency for an item.

A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.

A value of 0.5 is half see-through.

A value of 0 is completely transparent.

The value given will apply to the entire element, whether that's an image with some transparency, or the foreground and background colors for a block of text.


Applied Visual Design: Use the text-transform Property to Make Text Uppercase

The text-transform property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text. It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.

The following table shows how the different text-transformvalues change the example text "Transform me".

Value Result
lowercase "transform me"
uppercase "TRANSFORM ME"
capitalize  "Transform Me"
initial Use the default value
inherit Use the text-transform value from the parent element
none  Default: Use the original text

```html
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1);
    padding: 10px;
    font-size: 27px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
    opacity: 0.7;
  }
  #thumbnail {
    box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard" id="thumbnail">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Alphabet</h4>
      <hr>
      <p><em>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were <u>Ph.D. students</u> at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="cardLinks">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page" target="_blank" class="links">Larry Page</a><br><br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin" target="_blank" class="links">Sergey Brin</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```


Applied Visual Design: Set the font-size for Multiple Heading Elements

The font-size property is used to specify how large the text is in a given element. This rule can be used for multiple elements to create visual consistency of text on a page. In this challenge, you'll set the values for all h1 through h6 tags to balance the heading sizes.


Applied Visual Design: Set the font-size for Multiple Heading Elements

The font-size property is used to specify how large the text is in a given element. This rule can be used for multiple elements to create visual consistency of text on a page. 

The font-size property in CSS is not limited to headings, it can be applied to any element containing text.


Applied Visual Design: Set the font-weight for Multiple Heading Elements

You set the font-size of each heading tag in the last challenge, here you'll adjust the font-weight.

The font-weight property sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text.


```html
<style>
  h1 {
    font-size: 68px;
    font-weight: 800;
  }
  h2 {
    font-size: 52px;
    font-weight: 600;
  }
  h3 {
    font-size: 40px;
    font-weight: 500;
  }
  h4 {
    font-size: 32px;
    font-weight: 400;
  }
  h5 {
    font-size: 21px;
    font-weight: 300;
  }
  h6 {
    font-size: 14px;
    font-weight: 200;
  }
</style>
<h1>This is h1 text</h1>
<h2>This is h2 text</h2>
<h3>This is h3 text</h3>
<h4>This is h4 text</h4>
<h5>This is h5 text</h5>
<h6>This is h6 text</h6>
```

Applied Visual Design: Set the line-height of Paragraphs

CSS offers the line-height property to change the height of each line in a block of text. As the name suggests, it changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets.


```html
<style>
  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 25px;
  }
</style>
<p>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.
</p>
```

Applied Visual Design: Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag

This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element.

For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the :hover pseudo-class selector. Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:

```css
a:hover {
  color: red;
}
```

Applied Visual Design: Change an Element's Relative Position

CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model. Block-level items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans). The default layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.

When the position of an element is set to relative, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top or bottom. These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item away from where it is normally positioned. The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away from the bottom:

```css
p {
  position: relative;
  bottom: 10px;
}
```

Changing an element's position to relative does not remove it from the normal flow - other elements around it still behave as if that item were in its default position. Note: Positioning gives you a lot of flexibility and power over the visual layout of a page. It's good to remember that no matter the position of elements, the underlying HTML markup should be organized and make sense when read from top to bottom. This is how users with visual impairments (who rely on assistive devices like screen readers) access your content.

The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.
